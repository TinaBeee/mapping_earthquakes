Mapping earthquakes based on data by the U.S. Geological Survey using Leaflet and Mapbox to create an interactive map displaying latest global earthquakes

## Resources
- Earthquake Data: [here](https://on.doi.gov/3IuRBhA) & [here](https://on.doi.gov/3AqwV7N) (USGS data of past seven day earthquakes, and past seven day earthquakes of >4.5 quakes)
- Tectonic Plate Data: [here](https://bit.ly/3GWaQjM) (Github profile fraxen, GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json)
- Software: Visual Studio Code 1.60.0, D3 5.5.0, Leaflet 1.7.1, Mapbox

## Overview
Mapping_Challenge folder contains js, css and html files, which build a map with four different Mapbox layers, and three toggle layers to map all earthquakes, tectonic plate lines, and major earthquakes of magnitude 4.5 and higher. Earthquakes are mapped with circles, with radius and color illustrating magniude. Map legend on the bottom right hand corner explains colors.
